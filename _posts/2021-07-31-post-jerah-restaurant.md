There are many good resturants in the world, and there are many excellent ones here in Costa Rica. You can easily type in 'Resturant' into Google Maps and get a a lot of great options with reviews to your taste, etc. Then there are those places that you stumble across semi-randomly and they simply blow your mind. Like how is this food quality located here in Jaco, a few steps from the beach, on a second floor of another resturant!?

That's the story with Jerah - a true gem in the middle of Jaco that is an absolute must visit. Every time we go here and every time we take someone here they are amazed. Saying that this could have been a Michelin star restaurant in Tribeca, Mahnattan is not an exaguration at all.

The chef here is originaly from Germany, but has spent 3 years in Thailand training and has been perfecting his art every since here in Jaco, Costa Rica. The Thai food is absolutly amazing and does not compare to what you think of as "Thai Food" anywhere else.
This is a true authentic Thai food experience with every ingredient sourced with intention, with many localy grown with spices made from scratch by the Chef. The dishes and the menu will look familiar with soups like Tom Yum or Pad Thai main dishes, but their execution, will be nothing but extraordinary.

Anyways, go here now!
