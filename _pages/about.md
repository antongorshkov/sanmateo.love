## What is this site?

This site is a community space where we collect the best of San Mateo and the surrounding area has to offer. Beaches, places to eat, how to buy land, how to build a home, how to learn Spanish and connect with others in the community, all the resources you need to create the best version of yourself here as well as get a sense of what it's like living here.

## Who are we?

We are a group of internationals living in and around San Mateo area, either in Eco-Villa, Allegria or just in the area, exploring eco-friendly living.

## What unites us?

Permaculture, unschooling, meditation, natural building, star gazing, vegetarians, fruitarians, flexi-terians, yoga teachers and yoga followers, you name it, there is someone here who's got it. There is not one theme or school of thought that unites us, but a general tendency towards more conscious living, one that connects us to our true selves and nature.
