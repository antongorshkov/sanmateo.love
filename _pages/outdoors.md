## Beaches

- [Playa Pogeres aka "Vista Mar"](https://goo.gl/maps/psCWmYJvtjy62thP9) - is the closest beach from San Mateo, about 35 minute drive and best of all, you're driving on good paved roads only!
  - **Pros:** close to road, no waves, makkah sightings, no people (on weekdays you can be the only one frequently), access to coconuts, good sunset viewing point
  - **Cons:** close to road, sand quality is OKish
  - **Pro Tip:** park across from Vista Mar Restuarant
- [Playa Mantas](https://goo.gl/maps/ThN2rCt1VZbxrBdu6) - very scenic beach with a little white sand and the calmest water you'll ever see on this coast as the beach is inside a small bay.
  - **Pros:** calm water, scenic views, some white sand, showers
  - **Cons:** paid parking only which can be full on weekend, gets busy on weekends
  - **Pro Tip:** come here on weekdays
- [Playa Herradura](https://goo.gl/maps/oQ84LD4JvXg8BmA89) - very popular beach with great sand and smallish, but fun waves.
  - **Pros:** white sand, good water, great views
  - **Cons:** impossibly busy on weekends, avoid, but awesome on weekdays
  - **Pro Tip:** drive as far left as you can to avoid people and then walk even further left
- [Jaco Beach](https://goo.gl/maps/VanMgovhEAVzJA9s7) - the most popular beach in the area, packed with bars, restuarants and tourists.

  - **Pros:** big waves, great for surfing, good food options in town
  - **Cons:** touristy, beach itself doesn't feel cozy
  - **Pro Tip:** avoid

## Parks & Hikes

- [Parque Nacional Carara](https://goo.gl/maps/bxfLkmPYRjAFz9QD9) - great national park, just 30 minutes away. Walk through the Jungle with plenty of wildlife
  - **Pros:** 2 steps in and you're in a different world
  - **Cons:** mosquitos, be prepared
  - **Pro Tip:** get tickets and then drive up a bit to [this](https://goo.gl/maps/pSSn6RYbcWMVaDg78) parking lot
