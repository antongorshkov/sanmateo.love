## Beaches

[Playa Tivives](https://goo.gl/maps/DemwqQxXo2PhkhC86) - raw beach with no infrastructure around it - nature at it's purest.
{: .notice--info}

- **Pros:** long beach, big waves with a little bay that has calm water for kids to swim
- **Cons:** feels sort of "out there", even though it's not that far (this could be a pro)
- **Pro Tip:** visit here when you want to get away from it all

[Playa Pogeres aka "Vista Mar"](https://goo.gl/maps/psCWmYJvtjy62thP9) - is the closest beach from San Mateo, about 35 minute drive and best of all, you're driving on good paved roads only!
{: .notice--info}

- **Pros:** close to road, no waves, makkah sightings, no people (on weekdays you can be the only one frequently), access to coconuts, good sunset viewing point
- **Cons:** close to road, sand quality is OKish
- **Pro Tip:** park across from Vista Mar Restuarant

[Playa Mantas](https://goo.gl/maps/ThN2rCt1VZbxrBdu6) - very scenic beach with a little white sand and the calmest water you'll ever see on this coast as the beach is inside a small bay.
{: .notice--info}

- **Pros:** calm water, scenic views, some white sand, showers
- **Cons:** paid parking only which can be full on weekend, gets busy on weekends
- **Pro Tip:** come here on weekdays

[Playa Herradura](https://goo.gl/maps/oQ84LD4JvXg8BmA89) - very popular beach with great sand and smallish, but fun waves.
{: .notice--info}

- **Pros:** white sand, good water, great views
- **Cons:** impossibly busy on weekends, avoid, but awesome on weekdays
- **Pro Tip:** drive as far left as you can to avoid people and then walk even further left

[Jaco Beach](https://goo.gl/maps/VanMgovhEAVzJA9s7) - the most popular beach in the area, packed with bars, restuarants and tourists.
{: .notice--info}

- **Cons:** touristy, beach itself doesn't feel cozy

[El Pe√±on de Guacalillo](https://goo.gl/maps/CnSXg4x6PNyxqa1WA) - not exactly a beach, but beautiful place to explore caves and sinset views
{: .notice--info}

- **Pros:** Great views, big caves, unlike any other coast in the area
- **Cons:** a bit off the beaten path, therefore the path itself is a bit off (dirt road)
- **Pro Tip:** 4x4 preferrard, but doable with Sedan depending on season. Check tide tables for low tide to explore caves.
