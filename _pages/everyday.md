## Supermarkets

There are a number of local supermarkets in Orotina which you'll find on Google Maps - they will have the basics, but you will not find all the produce that you normally would at home. For a much better selection that's more akin to American-style super-market you have to drive to Auto-Mercado. There are many locations which you can find on the maps, the two closest to San Mateo are:

- [Auto Mercado - Plaza Herradura](https://goo.gl/maps/vmGtq92b97MXcAoq7) - this is the easiest one to drive to, takes about 40 minutes and avoids the main highway. You can also combine this easily with a beach stop.
- [Auto Mercado - Guácima](https://goo.gl/maps/U2Enpq2fQGsjtPFR7) - this is the closest one in San Jose area, it will have a very similar selection to the one in Herradura.
- [PriceSmart](https://goo.gl/maps/Zycub971F7NWUkBr8) - Costco of Costa Rica.  Your once-a-quarter trip to load up on essnetials and occasional hard to find things.  Good prices, large packages.  Membership required, but 1 year will only cost $40 or so.

Note that each Auto Mercado can have a slightly different set of products and you may find something in one and not the other.

## Healthy Food Stores

- [Macrobiótica Vida Natural Atenas](https://goo.gl/maps/CSAZMgPAyHKp4Dg88) - closest health food store that will have a decent selection of product snot foundin Auto-Mercado
- [Green Center Organic Super Market](https://goo.gl/maps/XTeYk8QyjAxmXUxY7) - this is the ultimate "Whole Foods" of Costa Rica. You will usually find almost everything here that you can't in other stores. Yes, it's pricey, and yes, it's not quite Whole Foods :)
- [Nueces Industriales](https://goo.gl/maps/fX54XAhwJqoViGMp7) - Almonds, Walnuts, Cashews, Hazelnuts, etc. All kind of nuts in bulk quantities and excellent prices. Go here once every month or so and stock up on all your nutty needs.

- [Cúrcuma](https://goo.gl/maps/AbvoJJn24YYMiNo2A) - for all your spices needs, almost everything here you'll need, though a bit pricey.
- [El Tramito a Granel Escazu](https://g.page/tramito?share) - assortment of spices, salts, grains and everything you need to cook, bake, season and even eat at once is overwhelming. Great for buying things in bulk.

## The "secret", but well known stuff

- **Organic Lady** - there is a lady that does Organic deliveries in the area and takes orders over WhatsApp, she has great selection of products, always fresh no packaging and excellent service. Please [Contact Us](/about/) for details.
- **Organic Coffee Beans** - you can get high-quality, delicious beans at the chicken parilla across the street from the gas station @ Orotina. Beans are from the Dota region. Sometimes they have bags of shade-grown and organic beans. The guy who runs it has family in the Dota area and that's why this random little place gets organic beans. (tks Nikki for the tip!)

## Restuarants

So as not to re-invent Yelp of Google Maps, I will only include the places here that I think are really worth a visit. Of course there are many more that you'll discover on your own.

- [Jerah Thai Restaurant in Jaco](https://goo.gl/maps/Pobg21EKcabRM3T67) - go there now! [Full Report](/blog/post-jerah-restaurant/).
- [Almendra Plant-Based Cuisine](https://goo.gl/maps/oWgSzu21zWZTbrp79) - about 30 minutes from San Mateo in Atenas, but very much worth it. Closest Plant-Based restuarant and very tasty.
- [Mae Culpa Restaurante y Pizzería a la Leña](https://g.page/maeculpa?share) - amazing views, good pizza & Itlian dishes (use Waze! really important for this one)
- [La Casita del Café](https://goo.gl/maps/gWvipbFB4PSS9BhGA) - good coffee and comida tipica, and a view to knock your socks off.
- [La Poza Blanca](https://goo.gl/maps/oZ75Aivgi3HS1fkD8) - local favorite
- [Malau Orotina](https://goo.gl/maps/PofPThFJ6be3BiGG6) - possibly best restaurant in Orotina.  Off the beaten path and standard fare, but quality food and service. Best Ceviche!
- [Monsoon Asian Bistro & Neapolitan Pizza](https://goo.gl/maps/MFpGYMC4DPpoXYNq8) - can you have a place that has awesome Indian and Great Pizza under one roof?  Apparently the answer is yes.
- [Choco-Tour San Mateo](https://g.page/Choco-Tour-Costa-Rica?share) - yes, it's a bit of a touristy thing, but not a tourist trap! Authentic chocolate tour, very educational.

## Places to Hang

- [Avenida Escazú](https://goo.gl/maps/LmcjhroH4JqvqdRk9) - feeling like you miss US? Perhaps you want to walk Santa Monica Boulevard or visit Miami Beach?  While not exactly like those places, this little street certainly rhymes.  Pretty stores, cute restaurants & cafes, all outdoors with good parking and very modern amenities. If you need to itch that "Modern City" itch, come here.
