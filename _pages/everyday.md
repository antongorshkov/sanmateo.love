## Supermarkets

There are a number of local supermarkets in Orotina which you'll find on Google Maps - they will have the basics, but you will not find all the produce that you normally would at home. For a much better selection that's more akin to American-style super-market you have to drive to Auto-Mercado. There are many locations which you can find on the maps, the two closest to San Mateo are:

- [Auto Mercado - Plaza Herradura](https://goo.gl/maps/vmGtq92b97MXcAoq7) - this is the easiest one to drive to, takes about 40 minutes and avoids the main highway. You can also combine this easily with a beach stop.
- [Auto Mercado - Guácima](https://goo.gl/maps/U2Enpq2fQGsjtPFR7) - this is the closest one in San Jose area, it will have a very similar selection to the one in Herradura.

Note that each Auto Mercado can have a slightly different set of products and you may find something in one and not the other.

## Other Healthy Food Stores

- [Macrobiótica Vida Natural Atenas](https://goo.gl/maps/CSAZMgPAyHKp4Dg88) - closest health food store that will have a decent selection of product snot foundin Auto-Mercado
- [Green Center Organic Super Market](https://goo.gl/maps/XTeYk8QyjAxmXUxY7) - this is the ultimate "Whole Foods" of Costa Rica. You will usually find almost everything here that you can't in other stores. Yes, it's pricey, and yes, it's not quite Whole Foods :)
- [Nueces Industriales](https://goo.gl/maps/fX54XAhwJqoViGMp7) - Almonds, Walnuts, Cashews, Hazelnuts, etc. All kind of nuts in bulk quantities and excellent prices. Go here once every month or so and stock up on all your nutty needs.

## Farmers Markets aka Feria del Agricultor

There are a lot of local farmers markets that take place weekly in various locations. Depending on location their size and selection will vary greatly and of course depending on season. The two closest to San Mateo are:

- [Feria del Agricultor San Mateo](https://goo.gl/maps/YgWdrJMwXyKDKMzn8) - every Thursday from 2pm - 9pm
- [Feria del Agricultor Orotina](https://goo.gl/maps/pz139vftniPLGZsA8) - every Friday from 5am - Noon

## The "secret", but well known stuff

- **Organic Lady** - there is a lady that does Organic deliveries in the area and takes orders over WhatsApp, she has great selection of products, always fresh no packaging and excellent service. Please [Contact Us](/about/) for details.

## Restuarants

So as not to re-invent Yelp of Google Maps, I will only include the places here that I think are really worth a visit. Of course there are many more that you'll discover on your own.

- [Jerah Thai Restaurant in Jaco](https://goo.gl/maps/Pobg21EKcabRM3T67) - go there now! [Full Report](/blog/post-jerah-restaurant/).
- [Almendra Plant-Based Cuisine](https://goo.gl/maps/oWgSzu21zWZTbrp79) - about 30 minutes from San Mateo in Atenas, but very much worth it. Closest Plant-Based restuarant and very tasty.
- [Choco-Tour San Mateo](https://g.page/Choco-Tour-Costa-Rica?share) - yes, it's a bit of a touristy thing, but not a tourist trap! Authentic chocolate tour, very educational.
